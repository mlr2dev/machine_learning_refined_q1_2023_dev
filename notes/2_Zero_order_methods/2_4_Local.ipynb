    " As opposed to the global optimization techniques described in the previous Section - where a large number of input points are sampled simultaneously with the lowest evaluation crowned the approximate global minimum - *local optimization methods* work by taking a single sample input and refine it sequentially, driving it towards an approximate minimum point.  Local optimization methods are by far the most popular mathematical optimization schemes used in machine learning / deep learning today, with particular local optimization algorithms being the subject of the next several Chapters (as well as a number of Sections beyond this part of the text).  Nonetheless, while there is substantial variation in the kinds of specific local optimization methods we will discuss going forward, they all share a common overarching framework which we introduce in this Section."
